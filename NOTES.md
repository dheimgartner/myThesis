## TODO

- [x] What own packages do I need?
  - Part of thesis are:
    - TRB23: modal splits => `~/github/mpp`
    - SNN data paper => `~/github/SNN/datapap`
    - Analysing response rates => `~/github/responseRateAnalysis`
    - TRB24: work arrangements (reduced version to avoid redundancy with data paper) => `~/github/SNN/trb24`
    - OPSR => `~/github/OPSR`
    - TWTE => `~/github/TWTE`
    - OPSRtools => `~/github/OPSRtools`
- [ ] Init github organization (fork including myThesis => make sure main branch is default)
  - [x] Can I clone the whole organization? => don't think so
- [ ] How to deal with the mounting and data loading in `mpp`? => new data package?
- [ ] Add these packages to `_CRAN` (make sure you are on the correct branch...) and install
  - [ ] `mpp`
  - [x] `datapap`: no vignette built
  - [x] `responseRateAnalysis`
  - [x] `trb24`: no vignettes folder
  - [x] `OPSR`
  - [x] `TWTE`
  - [x] `OPSRtools`
- [x] Think about main thesis structure (order of the papers)
- [ ] Port papers one by one
  - Author contributions section => Do I need some signature/confirmation from the co-authors?
